## 🔤 Fonts Featuring the Riyal Symbol

- **Riyal Liberation Sans** – An open-source alternative to `Arial`.
- **Riyal Times Newer Roman** – An open-source alternative to `Times New Roman`.

## 🚀 How to Use

The **Riyal symbol ( <img style="padding: 30px; background-color:white;" src="Riyal-Symbol.jpg" width="20" alt="Preview of the Riyal Symbol"> )** replaces the tilde (`~`) key on your keyboard.  
Simply type `~` while using the font, and it will display the Riyal symbol.

## 📌 Important Notes

Custom fonts are not universally available on all devices. When a document, website, or design specifies a particular font, the system displaying it must have that font installed. If the font is missing, the device will substitute a default font, which can alter the intended appearance.

### ✅ Ensuring Custom Fonts Display Correctly

To maintain font consistency across different devices and platforms, consider these methods:

- **Font Embedding in Documents** – Some file formats (such as Word and PowerPoint) allow font embedding, ensuring the correct font appears on other devices.
- **Web Font Hosting** – Websites can use `@font-face` in CSS to load fonts from a server, making them accessible across browsers and devices.
- **Converting Text to Outlines** – In design software, text can be converted into vector shapes, preserving its appearance regardless of font availability.
- **Using PDFs** – PDF files support font embedding, ensuring text remains visually consistent across different devices.

If a custom font does not appear as expected, it is likely due to missing font embedding, installation issues, or incorrect referencing.
